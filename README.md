# BeatMachine #

An easy to use simple drummachine.

It has been written in pure javascript and has just one dependency, which I also made ([npKnob](https://bitbucket.org/Navelpluisje/npknob)) for the rotary knobs. 
After cloning just run `bower install` and it will be included.

## How to beat? ##

Each sound has a few settings. I will explain them from top down:

* **Gain**: I like it loud, but sometimes not
* **Filter**: Check this one if you want to use the filter.
* **Filter Q**: The amount of filtering
* **Freq**: The filter frequency
* **Pan**: A bit to the left, a bit to the right.
* **Mute**: Oh, be quite now 

## Other controls ##

* **Start**: What would this one do??
* **Stop**: The opposite of the previous one
* **Speed**: Do you like it hardcore or laid back?
* **Drumset**: Choose the sound you like

## And........ ##

* **grid**: Toggle the sequencer grid. Just click the small bubbles and press start for some unforgettable fun;-)
